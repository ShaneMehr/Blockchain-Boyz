# Blockchain-Boyz
Group 27: Blockchain

The app we have designed provides a platform for a user friendly, comprehensive blockchain experience. Clients are able
to create an account and our platform will manage all of their blockchain needs. The news feed section of our app keeps
users up to date with what's latest in the crypto industry and important developments. The buy/sell section acts like a
personal wallet where people can facillitate their Ethereum transactions and view their balances in real time. The market
section of our app has a list of the top cryptocurrencies and their relevant data such as symbol, price, and % changes in price.
